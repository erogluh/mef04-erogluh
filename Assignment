About Me

Hi! My name is Hüseyin Eroğlu. I graduated from Political Science and Public Administration in 2016. After graduation, I started to work in Vakifbank as Internal Controller.       

Because of the technological changes in financial sector such as cryptocurrencies, I thought that banking sector is at risk and it need to change itself by using technology and big data. Banking sector has huge amount of customer data but mostly do not know how to use it efficiently. Therefore, I choose to do my master in the field of Big Data Analysis to use Big Data in Banking Sector.
